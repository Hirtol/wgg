# Where to Get Groceries (WGG)

Where to Get Groceries is a service where one can create a shopping cart, and subsequently
compare the price with all local/online grocery stores.

# Build
To build the back-end simply run:
* `cargo build`

To build the front-end:
* `cd wgg_front`
* `npm install`
* `npm run build`

# Development
For development one can run the back-end and front-end independently.

Back-end:
* `cargo run`

Front-end:
* `cd wgg_front`
* `npm install`
* `npm run dev`

The front-end will automatically refresh when making changes to the Svelte source files.
